## 🔍 Verified - No Changes Needed

### Files That Are Correct As-Is

#### `/lib/search-index.ts`

- **Status**: ✅ OK
- **Reason**: Only contains blog post URLs under `/personal-finance/*`, not the deleted category pages

#### `/lib/navigation/headerNavigation.ts`

- **Status**: ✅ OK
- **Reason**: Never had links to `/credit-cards` or `/personal-loans` categories (only to individual posts)

#### `/lib/navigation/footerNavigation.ts`

- **Status**: ✅ OK
- **Reason**: Only references valid category pages and blog posts

#### Blog Posts in `/app/personal-finance/*`

- **Status**: ✅ OK
- **Reason**: These are individual articles (like `best-personal-loans`, `cashback-credit-cards`), NOT the deleted category pages
- **Keep**: All internal links between blog posts are still valid

## 📝 Documentation References

### Historical Documentation (No Action Required)

The following documentation files reference the deleted directories but are **historical records** of past implementations. They should be kept as-is for reference:

#### In `/lib/documents/`

- `ADZEP_BLOG_OVERLAY_FIX.md` - AdZep implementation history
- `OVERLAY_BLUR_FIX.md` - Historical overlay fix documentation
- `PRIORITY_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Past priority implementation log
- `MOBILE_BUTTON_FIX.md` - Historical mobile fix record
- `blog-post-integration-checklist.md` - Legacy checklist
- `commit-message.txt` - Historical commit messages

#### In `/docs/`

- `UK_PRODUCTS_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md` - Past cleanup documentation
- `POST_SORTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Historical sorting changes
- `UK_PRODUCTS_PURGE_REPORT.md` - Historical purge report
- `HOMEPAGE_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - Past refactor documentation
- `SEO_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Historical SEO changes
- `UK_TO_US_LOCALIZATION_*.md` - Historical localization records
- `PERSONAL_FINANCE_CATEGORIZATION_FIX.md` - Past categorization changes

**Recommendation**: Keep these files unchanged - they serve as project history and troubleshooting references.
