### Documentation Files

While documentation files in `/lib/documents/` and `/docs/` contain UK
references, these are primarily:

- Historical migration documentation
- Blog post summaries for UK market reference
- Internal test data

These have been left intentionally as they document the UK-to-US migration
process itself.

### Configuration Files

- **cors-config.json**: Contains UK domain reference
  (`https://uk.budgetbeepro.com`) - maintained for CORS purposes
- **Test scripts**: Contain legacy £ symbols in test data - maintained for
  backward compatibility testing

## Content Quality Improvements

### Regulatory Compliance

- ✅ Removed all UK-specific regulatory references (FCA, HMRC)
- ✅ Updated to US-appropriate regulatory context
- ✅ Changed from prescriptive UK requirements to general US guidance
- ✅ Maintained educational tone without claiming specific regulatory expertise

### User Experience

- ✅ All currency displayed in dollars ($)
- ✅ Tax terminology matches US understanding
- ✅ Municipal services use US terms (property tax vs council tax)
- ✅ Employment tax references use US terminology

### Content Consistency

- ✅ American English spelling throughout content pages
- ✅ Consistent dollar amounts in examples
- ✅ US-appropriate contextual references

## Search Patterns Used

### Currency Search

```bash
grep -r "£\|pounds\|pence" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" app/
```

### UK Geographic Terms

```bash
grep -r "\bUK\b|United Kingdom|Great Britain|\bGB\b" --include="*.tsx" app/
```

### British Spelling

```bash
grep -r "organise|recognise|realise|favour|colour|centre|theatre|cheque" --include="*.tsx" app/
```

### UK Regulatory Terms

```bash
grep -r "FCA|Financial Conduct Authority|HMRC|council tax|sort code" --include="*.tsx" app/
```

## Areas Intentionally Preserved

### 1. npm Package References

- `@img/colour` package name in package-lock.json (npm package naming)
- UK domain references in CORS configuration (technical requirement)

### 2. Historical Documentation

- Migration summary documents in `/docs/`
- Blog post summary templates in `/lib/documents/`
- Test data in `/scripts/` directory

### 3. Author Data

- Author image URLs containing "/uk/" path (CDN structure)
- Historical blog workflow migration documentation
