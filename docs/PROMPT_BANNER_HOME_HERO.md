# BudgetBee Homepage Hero Banner - Image Generation Prompt

## 🎯 Target Image: `banner-home.webp`

**Purpose:** Primary homepage hero banner  
**Current Usage:** HeroSection component on homepage  
**Context:** First impression of BudgetBee brand - financial partnership and guidance

---

## ⚠️ Important Note on Generation Strategy

**Two-Stage Approach Recommended:**

Most image generation LLMs struggle to create both photorealistic imagery AND clean vector graphics in a single generation. For best results:

1. **Stage 1 (Use prompt below):** Generate the clean photography with proper composition
2. **Stage 2 (Post-production):** Add vector graphics (arrows/stars) in Photoshop, Figma, or Canva

If your LLM supports strong graphic overlay generation, you can try the full prompt. Otherwise, use **"Photography Only Prompt"** below.

## 📸 Complete Generation Prompt (Photography + Graphics Attempt)

ADD KARDTRUST BRAND VECTOR GRAPHICS (ABSTRACT ELEMENTS ONLY):

RED UPWARD ARROWS (Hex: #D72638):
CRITICAL: Position arrows in LEFT negative space to avoid text overlay conflicts

- Large hero arrow:
  * Bottom-left corner to mid-left area
  * Upward diagonal at 65° angle
  * Size: 18% of image width
  * Position: Far left side, starting from bottom edge
  * Should NOT overlap with subjects or text area

- Medium arrow:
  * Upper-left quadrant
  * Upward at 75° angle
  * Size: 10% of image width
  * Creates upward flow in negative space

- Small accent arrow:
  * Top-right area near edge
  * Upward at 80° angle
  * Size: 6% of image width
  * Balances composition on right side

- Style: Bold, modern geometric with smooth rounded edges
- Opacity: 88-92% to avoid overpowering hero message
- Placement: Concentrate arrows in LEFT negative space (where text won't be)

BLUE FOUR-POINTED STARS (Hex: #003DA5):
Position stars to frame subjects and enhance trust messaging

- Large star:
  * Top-left corner of frame
  * Size: 4% of image width
  * Prominent with subtle glow

- Medium star:
  * Near subjects' heads/shoulders area (upper center-right)

  * One bottom-right corner
  * One top-right near laptop area
  * Size: 1.5-2% of image width each
  * Accent elements for balance

- Style: Sharp four-pointed stars (compass/North Star style)
- Effect: Subtle glow with 20px outer glow at 30% opacity
- Opacity: 95-100% for premium feel

COMPOSITION ARCHITECTURE:
- LEFT ZONE (40%): Negative space with arrows and stars, text overlay area
- CENTER-RIGHT ZONE (60%): Subjects, laptop, documents (hero action)
- Depth layers:
  * Background: Warm blurred environment
  * Mid-layer: Some arrows/stars behind subjects
  * Foreground: Subjects, laptop, documents
  * Top layer: Stars and accent arrows in front

BRAND MESSAGE ALIGNMENT:
- Partnership & collaboration (two people working together)
- Trust & guidance (professional yet approachable)
- Financial empowerment (confident, engaged expressions)
- American market context (modern, diverse couple)
- Upward growth (arrows reinforcing positive financial trajectory)
- Excellence (stars emphasizing quality and trust)

HERO BANNER SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Must work with text overlay on LEFT side
- Subjects should be on RIGHT side for text balance
- Maintain 40-45% breathing room on LEFT
- Visual hierarchy: Subjects > Arrows > Stars
- Color contrast: Ensure text readability area
- Warm, inviting tone for homepage first impression

ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- High contrast between subjects and background
- Clear focal point (couple at laptop)
- Colors suitable for overlay text (dark or light)
- Vector elements don't compete with text space

OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Format: Landscape banner (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Recommended dimensions: 1920x600px or 1920x700px
- sRGB color space for web display
- WebP format ready (high quality source)
- Sharp, crisp edges on vector graphics
- Professional hero banner quality

FINAL RESULT:
A warm, inviting hero banner showing a diverse couple collaborating on financial planning, with BudgetBee brand elements (red upward arrows and blue stars) seamlessly integrated in the negative space. The image communicates partnership, trust, financial empowerment, and upward growth – perfectly aligned with BudgetBee's "Your Trusted Partner for Smart Financial Decisions" messaging.

The composition must allow for text overlay on the LEFT side while maintaining visual interest and brand consistency across the entire banner.

CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS:
- DO NOT include the BudgetBee logo (shield with arrow)
- DO NOT add any text, typography, letters, or words
- DO NOT include numbers, statistics, or data elements
- ONLY include: Photography + Red arrows + Blue stars (abstract vector graphics only)

## 🛠️ Post-Production: Adding Vector Graphics (Recommended Approach)

If vector graphics didn't generate (most common scenario), add them manually:

### Option 1: Photoshop/GIMP

1. Open generated photo in Photoshop
2. Create new layers above the photo
3. Use **Pen Tool** or **Shape Tool** to create arrows:
   - Color: #D72638 (Brand Red)
   - Style: Bold geometric with rounded edges
   - Position in left 40% negative space
   - 3 arrows total: 1 large (bottom-left), 2 smaller (upper-left, top-right)
   - Opacity: 88-92%
4. Create four-pointed stars:
   - Color: #003DA5 (Brand Blue)
   - Use polygon tool or custom shape
   - Add outer glow effect (20px, 30% opacity)
   - 5 stars scattered across composition
   - Opacity: 95-100%
5. Export as WebP (85% quality)

### Option 2: Figma/Canva

1. Import generated photo as background layer
2. Add vector shapes on top:
   - Arrows: Triangle/polygon tools, color #D72638
   - Stars: Star tool (4 points), color #003DA5
3. Position according to composition diagram above
4. Add blur/glow effects to stars
5. Adjust opacity and export

### Option 3: Online Tools

- **Photopea** (free Photoshop alternative): photopea.com
- **Pixlr** (online editor): pixlr.com
- **Canva** (design tool): canva.com
