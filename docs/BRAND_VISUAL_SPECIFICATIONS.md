## 4. Composition Architecture

### 4.1 Spatial Layout

**Rule of Thirds Grid:**

```bash
[Star] [    Subject    ] [Arrow↑]
[     ][               ] [Star  ]
[Arrow][               ] [Star  ]
```

**Depth Layers (Z-Index):**

1. **Background Layer:** Photography (deepest)
2. **Mid Layer:** Vector elements behind subject
3. **Subject Layer:** Main photographic subject
4. **Foreground Layer:** Vector elements in front
5. **Top Layer:** Accent stars (highest)

### 4.2 Visual Balance

**Asymmetric Composition:**

- Subject occupies left or right third (not center)
- Vector elements balance opposite side
- Create diagonal movement lines
- Maintain 40-50% negative space

**Visual Weight Distribution:**

- Subject: 50-60% visual weight
- Arrows: 25-30% visual weight
- Stars: 10-15% visual weight
- Negative space: 40-50% (critical for breathing room)
