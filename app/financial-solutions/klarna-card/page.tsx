                    The Klarna Card uniquely offers two payment modes you can

                    directly from your Klarna balance like any traditional debit
                    card—funds are deducted immediately and you're done. When

                    pay later mode before your next transaction, choosing from

                  The Klarna Card represents a new category of payment
                  flexibility—combining the instant gratification of debit card
                  spending with the budget-friendly approach of installment
                  plans. Issued by WebBank (Member FDIC), this Visa card works
                  everywhere you need it to, from your local coffee shop to
                  international retailers, both online and in physical stores.
                  The integrated Klarna balance account serves as your funding
                  source, allowing you to add money manually or set up automatic
                  top-ups to ensure you're always ready to shop.

                  The Klarna Card's dual-mode payment system gives you control
                  over every transaction. In debit mode, the card functions like
                  any traditional debit card—purchases are deducted immediately
                  from your Klarna balance, which you fund by transferring money
                  from your bank account. There are no fees for debit mode
                  transactions, and you'll see funds leave your balance in
                  real-time, making budgeting straightforward and transparent.

                  When you need more time to pay, pay later mode transforms your
                  next purchase into an installment plan. Before shopping, open
                  the Klarna app and tap "Plan a purchase" to request your
                  preferred payment option. Choose from Pay in 4 (four
                  interest-free payments every two weeks) or monthly financing
                  plans with rates from 0%-35.99% APR based on your
                  creditworthiness. The app shows you all available options
                  upfront, including any service fees, so you'll know exactly
                  what you'll pay before completing your purchase.

                  When you activate your Klarna Card, you automatically gain
                  access to Klarna balance—a WebBank-held money account (Member
                  FDIC) that serves as your card's funding source. Add money to
                  your balance manually from your linked bank account, or set up
                  automatic top-ups to trigger when your balance drops below a
                  threshold you specify or on a regular schedule you choose.
                  Your Klarna balance isn't just for card spending—it's a
                  full-featured money account where you can store funds, track
                  transactions, and earn interest.

                  Standard plan cardholders earn 0.01% interest on their Klarna
                  balance, but upgrade to a paid membership plan to
                  significantly boost your earnings. Member plans earn 2.65% APY
                  while Plus plans earn up to 3.02% APY on your
                  balance—competitive rates that help your money grow while you
                  save for future purchases. Deposits in your Klarna balance are
                  held at WebBank and are eligible for FDIC pass-through deposit
                  insurance coverage when certain conditions are met, providing
                  peace of mind for your stored funds.

                      online or in-store wherever contactless Visa payments are

                      where you prefer a tangible card experience. Choose from

                      automatic top-ups. Configure your Klarna balance to

                      on a schedule (weekly, biweekly, monthly) or when your
                      balance drops below an amount you choose. This hands-off
                      approach ensures your card always has funds available for
                      debit mode purchases without requiring constant manual
                      transfers.

                  The Klarna Card eliminates the friction from everyday shopping
                  by combining flexibility with simplicity. For routine
                  purchases where you prefer immediate payment, debit mode
                  handles transactions instantly without the overhead of payment
                  plans or interest calculations. When a larger purchase comes
                  up—furniture, electronics, travel bookings—simply switch to
                  pay later mode in seconds to spread the cost over time with
                  transparent terms shown upfront.

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  Unlike traditional credit cards with revolving balances and
                  compound interest, Klarna's pay later plans are fixed-term
                  installments with clear payoff dates. You'll know exactly when
                  you'll be debt-free from each purchase rather than carrying
                  balances indefinitely. Service fees for Pay in 4 plans range
                  from $0.75-$3 (or free with membership plans), while monthly
                  financing rates from 0%-35.99% APR are displayed before you
                  commit. This transparency helps you make informed decisions
                  about which payment method works best for each specific
                  purchase.
