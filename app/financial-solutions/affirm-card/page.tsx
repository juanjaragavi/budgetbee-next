                The Affirm Card is a Visa debit card that gives you the power to
                pay over time with transparent, flexible payment plans. Unlike

                the Affirm Card offers straightforward payment options from
                0%-36% APR with no annual fees, no late fees, and no surprise
                charges. Check your purchasing power without impacting your
                credit score, then decide how to pay—in full immediately or
                split into manageable installments over time.

                  The Affirm Card reimagines how debit cards work by combining
                  the convenience of instant payments with the flexibility of
                  installment plans. Issued by Evolve Bank & Trust or Stride
                  Bank, N.A. (both FDIC Members), the Affirm Card isn't a
                  traditional credit card—it's a Visa debit card with
                  intelligent payment options built in. This unique approach
                  means you avoid the debt spiral of revolving credit while
                  still accessing the payment flexibility you need for larger
                  purchases.

                  How Payment Plans Work
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Affirm Card offers multiple ways to structure your
                  payments. For everyday purchases, simply pay in full from your
                  linked bank account or Affirm Money Account—funds pull within
                  1-3 days of purchase with no interest or fees. For larger
                  purchases, request a payment plan before or after checkout
                  (within 24 hours for purchases $50+). Payment plans range from
                  interest-free Pay in 4 options (four payments every two weeks
                  at 0% APR) to extended monthly plans with rates from 0%-36%
                  APR based on your credit and the purchase amount.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  For example, an $800 purchase might be split into 12 monthly
                  payments of $77.99 at 30% APR, or four interest-free payments
                  of $200 every two weeks. Available plans vary by merchant and
                  your eligibility—you'll see all options upfront in the Affirm
                  app before committing. A down payment may be required for some
                  plans. This transparency helps you make informed decisions
                  about which payment structure works best for your budget.

                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Unlike traditional credit cards that charge compound interest
                  on revolving balances, Affirm uses simple interest for payment
                  plans—you'll never pay interest on interest. Each payment plan
                  has a fixed amount and schedule visible upfront, eliminating
                  surprises. This structure helps you budget effectively because
                  you know exactly what you'll pay each month without worrying
                  about changing minimum payments or variable interest rates
                  that make debt harder to manage.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Affirm Card also gives you the flexibility to decide after
                  your purchase. Made an eligible purchase over $50 but didn't
                  plan ahead for a payment plan? You have 24 hours post-purchase
                  to split it into installments through the Affirm app. This
                  "split after checkout" feature provides a safety net for
                  unexpected expenses or when you realize a purchase would be
                  easier to manage with monthly payments rather than one
                  immediate debit.

                  The Affirm Card helps you take control of your spending with
                  transparent terms and flexible options. Unlike traditional
                  credit cards that can lead to growing debt through compound
                  interest and minimum payments, Affirm's approach encourages
                  responsible financial management. You'll always know what you
                  owe, when payments are due, and exactly how much interest
                  you'll pay (if any) before you commit to a payment plan.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  This transparency is especially valuable for larger purchases
                  where spreading payments over time makes practical sense.
                  Whether you're buying furniture, electronics, or making other
                  significant purchases, the Affirm Card gives you the freedom
                  to choose payment terms that work for your budget. No surprise
                  fees, no hidden charges, and no compound interest—just
                  straightforward payment options that help you manage your
                  finances with confidence.
