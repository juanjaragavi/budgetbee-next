                      Upgrade OneCard is generally accessible to applicants with
                      fair to good credit. Most approved applicants have credit
                      scores of 580 or higher, though your actual approval and
                      interest rate will depend on your complete credit profile,
                      not just your score. A higher credit score qualifies you
                      for lower APRs within the 14.99% to 29.99% range.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-5">
                      While Upgrade doesn't publish a minimum credit score, most
                      approved applicants have credit scores of 580 or higher.
                      Your credit score, along with your income, debt-to-income
                      ratio, and credit history, will determine your approval,
                      credit line, and APR. Higher credit scores qualify for
                      better terms and lower interest rates.

                      Will checking my offers hurt my credit score?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-5">
                      No. The initial pre-qualification process uses a soft
                      credit inquiry that won't affect your credit score. Only
                      if you proceed with a full application and accept an offer
                      will Upgrade perform a hard inquiry, which may have a
                      minor temporary impact on your score.

                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-5">
                      When you designate a purchase as Pay Now, Upgrade will
                      automatically debit your linked bank account the day after
                      the transaction settles. This pays off the purchase
                      immediately and eliminates any interest charges. You must
                      have sufficient funds in your account for the automatic
                      debit, or the transaction will be switched to Pay Later
                      and begin accruing interest.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-5">
                      Yes. You can change the designation of any transaction
                      from Pay Now to Pay Later (or vice versa) up until 12pm
                      Pacific Time the day after the transaction settles. After
                      this deadline, the designation is locked and the payment
                      or installment plan will proceed as designated.

                      If a Pay Now debit is returned by your bank due to
                      insufficient funds, Upgrade will automatically switch that
                      transaction to Pay Later. The transaction will begin
                      accruing interest from the original transaction date and
                      be added to your regular installment payments. You may
                      also be charged a returned payment fee.
