                      The Chase Sapphire Reserve® typically requires a credit
                      score of 720 or higher, though many approved applicants
                      have scores of 750+. Chase evaluates your FICO® Score and
                      credit report from major credit bureaus (Experian,
                      Equifax, TransUnion) to assess creditworthiness. A strong
                      credit history demonstrates responsible credit management,
                      on-time payments, low credit utilization (ideally under
                      30%), and a mix of credit accounts. Before applying,
                      review your credit reports for accuracy and dispute any
                      errors that could negatively impact your application.

                      Chase applies the "5/24 rule" to most credit card
                      applications—if you've opened 5 or more credit cards (from
                      any bank, not just Chase) within the past 24 months,
                      you'll likely be automatically declined regardless of your
                      credit score or income. This rule counts all personal
                      credit cards that appear on your credit report, including
                      retail store cards and authorized user accounts in some
                      cases. Business credit cards from certain issuers may not
                      count toward 5/24. Review your credit report carefully and
                      count recent card openings before applying. If you're at
                      or near 5/24, consider waiting until you drop below 5
                      cards in the 24-month window.

                      You must be at least 18 years old to apply (or 19 in
                      Alabama and 21 in Mississippi). You must be a U.S.
                      citizen, permanent resident, or have a valid work visa
                      with a U.S. residential address. International students
                      and temporary workers may qualify if they meet other
                      eligibility requirements and can provide appropriate
                      documentation. Chase requires a valid Social Security
                      Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
                      for identity verification and credit reporting purposes.

                      While Chase doesn't publish a specific minimum income
                      requirement, the $550 annual fee and premium positioning
                      suggest you should have substantial income to comfortably
                      afford the card. Most approved applicants report annual
                      incomes of $50,000 or higher, though higher incomes
                      increase approval odds. Chase evaluates your income
                      relative to existing debt obligations (debt-to-income
                      ratio) to ensure you can manage additional credit
                      responsibly. You may report total household income if
                      you're married or have reasonable access to those funds,
                      which can strengthen your application if your personal
                      income is modest.

                      must downgrade or close it before applying for the other
                      Sapphire product. Additionally, you're ineligible for the
                      welcome bonus if you've received a bonus on any Sapphire
                      card (Preferred or Reserve) within the past 48 months.
                      This restriction applies even if you closed the previous

                      many successful applicants in the 750+ range. Excellent

                      The 5/24 rule means Chase will typically deny your
                      application if you've opened 5 or more credit cards (from
                      any bank) within the past 24 months. This includes most
                      personal credit cards but excludes business cards from
                      certain issuers and some store cards. Authorized user

                      the past 48 months. You also cannot hold another Sapphire
                      card simultaneously. If you have a Sapphire Preferred®,
                      you must downgrade or close it before applying for the

                      insurance and purchase protections, the benefits typically
                      exceed the annual cost. However, infrequent travelers who

                      card and can help you earn rewards on their purchases.
                      Authorized users also receive most of the card's travel

                  Important Disclaimers and Risk Warnings:
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Credit cards are a form of
                  borrowing that must be managed responsibly. Missing payments
                  can severely damage your credit score, result in late fees and
                  penalty APRs, and create long-term financial difficulties. The
                  Chase Sapphire Reserve® carries high interest rates (21.49% -
                  28.49% variable APR) that can quickly negate the value of
                  rewards earned if you carry a balance. Only apply for this
                  card if you can afford the $550 annual fee and can commit to
                  paying your balance in full each month to avoid interest
                  charges. The card works best for consumers with stable income,
                  excellent credit, and disciplined spending habits.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Credit Impact:</strong> Applying for any credit card
                  generates a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may
                  temporarily lower your credit score by a few points. Opening a
                  new account also reduces your average age of accounts, which
                  can impact your score. However, responsible use of the card
                  (on-time payments, low utilization) typically improves your
                  credit score over time. Only apply if you genuinely need the
                  card and meet the eligibility criteria—avoid applying
                  speculatively.

                  </strong>{" "}
                  If you charge $10,000 in purchases at an APR of 25% and make
                  only minimum payments, you will pay approximately $3,200 in
                  interest charges over approximately 12 years before the
                  balance is fully paid off. Your actual APR, interest charges,
                  and payoff period depend on your creditworthiness, payment
                  behavior, and market interest rate changes. To avoid interest
                  entirely, pay your full statement balance by the due date each
                  billing cycle.

                  <strong>Before Applying:</strong> Carefully consider whether
                  the Chase Sapphire Reserve® aligns with your financial
                  situation, spending habits, and credit goals. Evaluate whether
                  you can afford the annual fee and will utilize the benefits
