                      permanent resident, or have a valid U.S. work visa with a
                      U.S. residential address. American Express does not accept
                      P.O. boxes as primary addresses. You must also have a
                      valid Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer

                      The Blue Cash Preferred Card typically requires good to
                      excellent credit, generally corresponding to FICO scores
                      of 670 or higher, with the best approval odds for scores
                      above 700. American Express is known for conducting
                      thorough creditworthiness evaluations that consider more
                      than just your credit score, including payment history,
                      credit utilization, length of credit history, recent
                      credit inquiries, and existing debt obligations. While
                      there's no published minimum credit score requirement,
                      applicants with excellent credit (750+) have the highest
                      approval rates and may receive more favorable terms.
                      Recent negative marks such as late payments, collections,
                      charge-offs, or bankruptcies may significantly reduce
                      approval odds or result in denial.

                      You must have a verifiable source of income to demonstrate
                      your ability to make monthly payments on the card.
                      American Express does not publish a minimum income
                      requirement, but applicants should have sufficient income
                      to comfortably manage the card's annual fee and potential
                      spending. Acceptable income sources include employment
                      income (salary, wages, bonuses, commissions),
                      self-employment income, business income, retirement income
                      (Social Security, pension, 401(k) distributions),
                      investment income (dividends, interest, rental income), or
                      alimony and child support (if you choose to include it).
                      If you're under 21, the Credit CARD Act requires that you
                      demonstrate independent income or have a co-signer.
                      American Express may verify your income through pay stubs,
                      tax returns, bank statements, or third-party verification
                      services.

                      </span>{" "}
                      American Express carefully reviews your credit history,
                      looking for consistent on-time payment patterns across all
                      credit obligations. They evaluate the length of your
                      credit history—longer histories with established accounts
                      improve approval odds. American Express also considers
                      your credit utilization ratio (the percentage of available
                      credit you're using); lower utilization rates (ideally
                      below 30%) indicate responsible credit management. Recent
                      credit inquiries are also assessed—multiple recent hard
                      inquiries may suggest credit-seeking behavior that could
                      reduce approval odds. If you have limited credit history,
                      consider starting with American Express's entry-level
                      cards like the Blue Cash Everyday® Card before upgrading
                      to the Blue Cash Preferred.

                      If you currently have an American Express card in good
                      standing, your approval odds may be higher due to your
                      established relationship with the company. American
                      Express values existing customers who demonstrate
                      responsible account management. However, be aware that
                      American Express enforces certain restrictions: You cannot
                      hold multiple versions of the same card simultaneously,
                      and you may not be eligible for the welcome bonus if
                      you've had the card or received a welcome bonus on a Blue
                      Cash product within the past 24 months. Check American
                      Express's current bonus eligibility rules before applying.

                      </span>{" "}
                      While American Express doesn't publicly disclose a maximum
                      debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, they assess your ability to
                      manage additional credit responsibly. A DTI ratio below
                      40% is generally favorable for credit card approvals,
                      though lower ratios (under 30%) provide the best approval
                      odds. American Express calculates your DTI by dividing
                      your monthly debt obligations by your gross monthly
                      income. High DTI ratios suggest financial stress and may
                      result in application denial or lower credit limits even
                      with good credit scores.

                      The Blue Cash Preferred Card charges a variable Annual
                      Percentage Rate (APR) ranging from 19.24% to 29.99% on
                      purchases and balance transfers, based on your
                      creditworthiness. The APR is variable, meaning it can
                      change when the U.S. Prime Rate changes. As of October
                      2025, the Prime Rate is approximately 7.5%, and American
                      Express adds a margin determined by your credit profile
                      (typically 11.74% to 22.49%). Applicants with excellent
                      credit scores (750+) and strong payment histories
                      typically receive APRs at the lower end of the range,
                      while those with fair credit or limited credit histories
                      may receive higher APRs. Your specific APR will be
                      disclosed in your approval notification and is subject to
                      periodic adjustment based on Prime Rate changes.

                      for the first year, then $95 per year thereafter. The
                      annual fee is charged to your account annually and is
                      non-refundable once charged, even if you close your
                      account. However, if you spend just $125 per month at
                      supermarkets ($1,500/year), you'll earn $90 in cash
                      back—nearly covering the fee. When combined with spending
                      in other bonus categories (streaming, gas/transit), most
                      active cardholders earn significantly more than the $95

                      If you fail to make at least the minimum payment by the
                      due date, American Express charges a late payment fee of
                      up to $40 (amount varies based on your balance and payment
                      history). Late payments can also result in penalty APRs,
                      negative impacts to your credit score, and potential
                      account restrictions. Similarly, if your payment is
                      returned unpaid by your bank due to insufficient funds or
                      closed accounts, you'll be charged a returned payment fee
                      of up to $40. To avoid these fees and protect your credit
                      score, set up automatic payments for at least the minimum
                      amount due, or better yet, pay your balance in full each
                      month to avoid interest charges entirely.

                      If you use your Blue Cash Preferred Card for cash advances
                      (at ATMs, bank branches, or through convenience checks),
                      you'll be charged a cash advance fee equal to the greater
                      of $10 or 5% of each cash advance amount. Cash advances
                      also begin accruing interest immediately at the cash
                      advance APR with no grace period, making them an expensive
                      way to access cash. For transactions made in foreign
                      currencies or with merchants located outside the United
                      States, American Express charges a foreign transaction fee
                      of 2.7% of the transaction amount after conversion to U.S.
                      dollars. If you travel internationally frequently,

                      American Express provides a grace period of at least 25
                      days between the end of a billing cycle and the payment
                      due date for purchases. This means you won't be charged
                      interest on new purchases if you pay your new balance in
                      full by the due date each billing cycle. The grace period
                      only applies to purchases, not cash advances or balance
                      transfers. If you carry a balance from one month to the
                      next, you'll lose the grace period and pay interest on new
                      purchases from the transaction date. To maximize the value
                      of your cash back rewards and avoid interest charges,

                      Before applying, honestly assess your monthly spending in
                      the bonus categories. Calculate your expected annual cash
                      back earnings: multiply your annual supermarket spending
                      (up to $6,000) by 6%, streaming subscriptions by 6%,
                      gas/transit spending by 3%, and other purchases by 1%.
                      Subtract the $95 annual fee (after the first year) to
                      determine your net annual value. If the net value is
                      positive and substantial, proceed with the application. If
                      your grocery spending is under $1,500 annually, consider
                      the no-annual-fee Blue Cash Everyday® Card instead.

                      credit score by a few points (typically 5-10 points). This
                      inquiry remains on your credit report for up to 2 years

                      used responsibly (paying on time, maintaining low
                      utilization), the card can help improve your credit score
                      over time by increasing your available credit and building
                      positive payment history. Avoid applying for multiple

                    cash back earnings in the bonus categories to ensure the
                    annual fee is justified by the rewards you'll earn. If you
                    spend less than $1,500 annually at supermarkets, the
                    no-annual-fee Blue Cash Everyday® Card may be a better
                    value.

                    Missing payments or carrying balances will result in
                    interest charges that can significantly outweigh any cash
                    back rewards earned. Late payments can damage your credit
                    score, result in late payment fees up to $40, and may
                    trigger penalty APRs. To maximize the value of this card,
                    pay your balance in full each billing cycle to avoid
                    interest charges. Cash back rewards are most valuable when
                    you practice responsible credit management and avoid debt
                    accumulation.
