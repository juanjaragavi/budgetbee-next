                    situation improves, helping you access more credit as you

                  The Avant Credit Card addresses a specific need in the credit
                  market—providing access to credit for consumers who may not
                  qualify for traditional rewards cards or premium credit
                  products. Issued by WebBank and backed by Mastercard's global
                  payment network, this card works at millions of locations
                  worldwide, both online and in physical stores. The focus here
                  isn't on earning points or cashback—it's on building a
                  positive credit history while accessing the credit you need
                  for everyday purchases and unexpected expenses.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Avant Credit Card recognizes that not everyone has perfect
                  credit, and many consumers need a credit product that works
                  with their current financial situation while helping them
                  improve it. Unlike secured credit cards that require you to
                  deposit hundreds of dollars upfront as collateral, the Avant
                  Credit Card requires no security deposit—your approved credit
                  limit is available to use immediately without tying up your
                  cash. This makes the card more accessible for consumers who
                  need credit but don't have extra funds to lock away in a
                  security deposit.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Credit limits range from $300 to $3,000 depending on your
                  creditworthiness and ability to repay, giving you meaningful
                  buying power for essential purchases. As you use the card
                  responsibly—making purchases, staying within your credit
                  limit, and paying on time—your activity is reported to the
                  major credit bureaus. This reporting helps you build a
                  positive credit history, which is essential for improving your
                  credit score and qualifying for better credit products in the
                  future.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Avant Credit Card maintains straightforward pricing with
                  no hidden surprises. Applications submitted directly through
                  the Avant website currently receive terms of 35.99% APR,
                  $39-$75 annual membership fee, and a minimum credit limit of
                  $300. If you received a pre-approved offer in the mail, refer
                  to your letter for the specific terms offered to you, as
                  pricing may vary based on offers provided through different
                  channels. The annual membership fee is charged once per year
                  and covers the cost of account maintenance and card services.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  While the APR is higher than cards designed for consumers with
                  excellent credit, this reflects the card's positioning as a
                  credit-building product for consumers with fair or building
                  credit. The key to managing this card cost-effectively is
                  paying your balance in full each month when possible to avoid
                  interest charges. The transparent fee structure means you'll
                  always know what you're paying—no overlimit fees, no penalty
                  APR increases, and no hidden charges that suddenly appear on
                  your statement.

                      Mastercard Zero Liability protection means you won't be
                      held responsible for unauthorized transactions on your

                      or used fraudulently, you're protected from liability for
                      those unauthorized charges. This security feature gives
                      you peace of mind when using your card for purchases both
                      online and in physical stores.

                      Unlike secured credit cards that require you to deposit
                      money as collateral (often $200-$500 or more), the Avant
                      Credit Card is an unsecured card—no deposit needed. Your
                      approved credit limit is available to use immediately
                      without tying up your cash in a security deposit. This
                      makes the card more accessible for consumers who need
                      credit but don't have extra funds to lock away, and it
                      means your cash remains liquid for other expenses.

                      with your credit-building goals. Seeing your progress

                  Using Your Card Responsibly
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  The Avant Credit Card's primary value lies in its
                  credit-building potential, which is maximized through
                  responsible use. To get the most benefit from this card, focus
                  on making regular purchases within your means, paying your
                  balance on time every month (ideally in full to avoid
                  interest), and keeping your credit utilization ratio
                  low—experts typically recommend using no more than 30% of your
                  available credit limit. These habits not only help you avoid
                  fees and interest charges but also demonstrate
                  creditworthiness to the bureaus that track your payment
                  behavior.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  The mobile app makes responsible credit management easier by
                  providing real-time access to your account. Set up payment
                  reminders to ensure you never miss a due date, monitor your
                  spending to stay within your budget, and check your balance
                  before making purchases to avoid approaching your credit
                  limit. Over time, this consistent responsible use can help
                  improve your credit score, potentially opening doors to better
                  credit products with lower interest rates, higher credit
                  limits, and more favorable terms in the future.
