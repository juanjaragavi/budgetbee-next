              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-left">
                The Citi Simplicity Card requires applicants to meet specific
                financial and personal criteria to ensure responsible credit
                management:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2 text-left">
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit score:</strong> Applicants need a minimum
                  credit score of 670 or higher, considered good credit. This
                  demonstrates a track record of on-time payments and
                  responsible credit use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>U.S. residency:</strong> A valid U.S. address and
                  Social Security Number are required for identity verification
                  and credit checks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Minimum age:</strong> Applicants must be at least 18
                  years old to qualify for the card.

                <li>
                  <strong>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI):</strong> A manageable
                  debt-to-income ratio is essential for approval, as Citi
                  evaluates your ability to handle additional credit
                  responsibly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stable income:</strong> Proof of consistent income

              <strong>Credit Score Threshold</strong>A credit score of 670 or
              higher demonstrates financial responsibility and increases your
              likelihood of approval. Lower scores might result in rejection or
              require alternative credit-building options.
              <strong>Residency and Identification Verification</strong>
              Citi relies on your address and SSN for comprehensive credit
              checks and identity validation. Ensure these details are accurate
              and up-to-date when applying.
              <strong>Financial Stability Assessment</strong>
              Citi evaluates your income against existing debts to gauge your
              repayment capacity. Keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 36%
              significantly increases your approval odds and may result in
              better terms.

                Tips for Successful Application
              </h2>
              <strong>Check Your Credit Report</strong>
              Review your credit report for any discrepancies or errors before
              applying. Dispute any inaccuracies that might negatively impact
              your application.
              <strong>Pay Down Existing Balances</strong>
              Reduce outstanding debt to improve your debt-to-income ratio and
              demonstrate responsible credit management to potential lenders.
              <strong>Maintain Consistent Income</strong>
              Steady employment and income reassure lenders of your financial
              stability and ability to make regular payments.
              <strong>Apply When You Need It</strong>
              Only apply when you genuinely need the card, as multiple
              applications in a short period can temporarily lower your credit
              score.
