fix: Add comprehensive button validation for Step 3 form submission

Implemented proper form validation logic to ensure the submit button only activates when ALL required conditions are met simultaneously.

Problem:
- Button was activating when only checkbox was checked, ignoring field validation
- Users could attempt submission with invalid or empty email/name fields
- Validation errors were displayed but button remained enabled
- Poor UX allowing form submission with incomplete/invalid data

Solution:
- Added isFormValid() helper function to check all validation conditions
- Button now requires: filled email, valid email format, filled name, valid name length, and accepted terms
- Button state (enabled/disabled and yellow/gray) now reflects complete form validity
- Prevents submission attempts when any validation condition fails

Technical Implementation:
```tsx
const isFormValid = () => {
  // Check if fields are filled
  const hasEmail = email.trim().length > 0;
  const hasFirstName = firstName.trim().length > 0;
  const hasAcceptedTerms = receiveMessages;

  // Check if there are no validation errors
  const noErrors = !errors.email && !errors.firstName;

  // All conditions must be met
  return hasEmail && hasFirstName && hasAcceptedTerms && noErrors;
};
```

Validation Requirements:
1. ✅ Email field must be filled (email.trim().length > 0)
2. ✅ Email must be valid format (!errors.email)
3. ✅ First Name field must be filled (firstName.trim().length > 0)
4. ✅ First Name must meet minimum length (!errors.firstName)
5. ✅ Terms checkbox must be checked (receiveMessages === true)

Button Behavior:
Previous:
```tsx
disabled={!receiveMessages || isSubmitting}
className={receiveMessages && !isSubmitting ? "yellow" : "gray"}
```

Current:
```tsx
disabled={!isFormValid() || isSubmitting}
className={isFormValid() && !isSubmitting ? "yellow" : "gray"}
```

Benefits:
✅ Button only activates when all validation passes
✅ Visual feedback matches actual form validity state
✅ Prevents invalid form submissions
✅ Better UX with clear indication of form completeness
✅ Consistent validation across all form fields
✅ Real-time button state updates as user fills form

User Experience:
- Button starts gray/disabled (empty form)
- Remains gray if any field has validation errors
- Remains gray if any field is empty
- Remains gray if terms not accepted
- Turns yellow/enabled only when ALL conditions met
- Clear visual feedback of form readiness
