Refactor: Rename fix-jsx-comments.py to fix_jsx_comments.py for Python naming convention

- Renamed scripts/fix-jsx-comments.py to scripts/fix_jsx_comments.py following Python naming standards
- Updated all documentation references to reflect the new filename
- Files updated: BUDGETBEE_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md, MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, MIGRATION_VERIFICATION.md, FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md
- No functional changes, purely organizational improvement
