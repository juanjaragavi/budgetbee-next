fix: Remove standalone output mode for Vercel compatibility

- Removed 'output: "standalone"' from next.config.mjs
- Standalone mode is incompatible with Vercel's serverless architecture
- This was preventing Next.js image optimization from working on Vercel
- Fixes remote image rendering issues on staging deployment
- Images from all whitelisted CDN domains should now load correctly
