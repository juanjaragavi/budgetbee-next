style: Update category highlight box colors to match original design

Updated the category highlight boxes on the blog page to match the original Astro site design:
- Personal Finance Guides: Changed from white/gray to blue background (#E8F4FD) with blue text (#2E5C8A)
- Financial Solutions: Changed from white/gray to green background (#E8F8F0) with green text (#1D6E4F)
- Updated hover states to slightly darker shades for better UX
- Maintained consistent spacing and rounded corners

This change improves visual consistency with the original BudgetBee brand identity and makes category sections more visually distinct.
