fix: Simplify PM2 user permissions in deployment script

Deployment Script Update:
- Removed `-u juanjaramillo` user specification from PM2 commands
- Changed `sudo -u juanjaramillo pm2 restart` to `sudo pm2 restart`
- Changed `sudo -u juanjaramillo pm2 save` to `sudo pm2 save`
- Simplifies deployment process by running PM2 commands directly with sudo

Technical Details:
- Fixes potential permission issues during automated deployments
- PM2 will run as the sudo user's default process owner
- Maintains functionality while reducing command complexity
