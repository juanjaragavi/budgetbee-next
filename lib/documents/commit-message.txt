fix: Reduce checkbox size for better mobile display in Step 3

Further refined checkbox sizing to fix excessive width on mobile devices in the Step 3 quiz form.

Issue:
- Checkbox at h-5 w-5 (20px × 20px) appeared too large on mobile screens
- Created visual imbalance with text label on smaller viewports
- User reported checkbox still too wide after previous fix

Changes Applied:
- Reduced checkbox size from h-5 w-5 to h-4 w-4 (16px × 16px)
- Updated gap from gap-3 to gap-2.5 for tighter spacing on mobile
- Maintained flex-shrink-0 to prevent expansion
- Kept all other styling (colors, border-2, flex-1 on label, etc.)

Technical Details:
- Checkbox dimensions: 20px × 20px → 16px × 16px
- Container gap: 12px (gap-3) → 10px (gap-2.5)
- Better proportions for mobile viewports (360px - 414px width)
- Standard checkbox size for better mobile UX

Result:
✅ Checkbox now properly sized for mobile devices (16px × 16px)
✅ Better visual balance with text on small screens
✅ Tighter, more compact layout suitable for mobile
✅ Maintains proper alignment and legibility
✅ Validated on mobile viewport in DevTools
