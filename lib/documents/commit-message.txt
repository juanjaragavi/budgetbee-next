fix: Refactor checkbox layout to prevent full-width issue on mobile

Complete restructure of checkbox/label layout to fix persistent full-width display issue on mobile devices in Step 3 form.

Problem:
- Previous flex container approach still resulted in full-width checkbox on mobile
- Checkbox appeared to take entire container width despite size constraints
- h-4 w-4 and flex-shrink-0 were not sufficient to constrain mobile display
- Required alternative layout structure for mobile viewports

Solution Implemented:
- Restructured HTML: moved checkbox inside Label element as direct child
- Changed container from separate div with Checkbox + Label to single Label wrapper
- Checkbox now positioned inline with text using nested flex layout
- Added min-w-[16px] to explicitly enforce minimum width constraint
- Wrapped text content in <span> with flex-1 for proper flow
- Simplified layout removes extra container causing width issues

Technical Changes:
Previous structure:
```
<div className="flex items-start gap-2.5">
  <Checkbox />
  <Label>text</Label>
</div>
```

New structure:
```
<Label className="flex items-start gap-2">
  <Checkbox className="min-w-[16px]" />
  <span className="flex-1">text</span>
</Label>
```

Key Improvements:
- Checkbox constrained by min-w-[16px] AND natural h-4 w-4 sizing
- Better semantic HTML with checkbox inside label
- Simpler DOM structure eliminates mobile layout bugs
- Gap reduced from 2.5 to 2 (8px) for tighter mobile spacing
- Text wrapped in span with flex-1 prevents layout collapse

Result:
✅ Checkbox displays at correct 16px × 16px size on mobile
✅ No full-width expansion or layout issues
✅ Better mobile UX with proper spacing
✅ Desktop layout remains unaffected
✅ More robust layout structure
