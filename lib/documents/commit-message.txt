fix: Correct checkbox alignment and width in Step 3 form

Fixed CSS layout issue causing checkbox misalignment and excessive width in the Step 3 quiz form component.

Problem Identified:
- Checkbox element had excessive width causing misalignment with adjacent text label
- Poor vertical and horizontal alignment between checkbox and label
- Text label was not fully legible due to spacing issues
- Layout inspection via Chrome DevTools revealed flex container issues

CSS Corrections Applied:
- Changed container from "space-x-3" to "gap-3" for more consistent spacing
- Added "flex-shrink-0" to checkbox to prevent it from expanding beyond h-5 w-5 dimensions
- Added "flex-1" to label to allow proper text wrapping and expansion
- Maintained mt-0.5 on checkbox for optimal vertical alignment with first line of text
- Preserved all other styling (border-2, colors, etc.)

Technical Changes:
- Container: "flex items-start space-x-3" → "flex items-start gap-3"
- Checkbox: Added "flex-shrink-0" class to maintain fixed 20px × 20px size
- Label: Added "flex-1" class for proper text flow and alignment

Result:
✅ Checkbox now maintains standard size (h-5 w-5 = 20px × 20px)
✅ Proper vertical alignment between checkbox and text label
✅ Text label is fully legible and positioned correctly
✅ No layout displacement or excessive width issues
✅ Validated via browser and DevTools inspection
