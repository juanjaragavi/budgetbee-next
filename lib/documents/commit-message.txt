style: Improve option button alignment and spacing for better visual consistency

Fixed checkbox alignment issues in quiz option buttons to match the original design:

Option Button Layout Improvements:
- Changed horizontal padding from px-6 to pl-5 pr-5 for consistent spacing
- Added flex-1 to label text to allow proper expansion
- Added pr-4 to label for spacing between text and radio button
- Added ml-auto to radio button to ensure consistent right alignment
- Radio buttons now properly aligned to the right edge with consistent padding
- Better visual balance between text content and selection indicator

Technical Changes:
- Updated flex layout structure for better control
- Label now uses flex-1 class for proper text wrapping
- Radio button maintains flex-shrink-0 to prevent compression
- Added explicit margin-left auto for consistent right positioning

Visual Result:
- All radio buttons (checkboxes) aligned consistently to the right
- Proper padding from container edges on both left and right
- Cleaner, more professional appearance matching original Astro design
- Better visual hierarchy and spacing throughout

Files Modified:
- components/ui/option-button.tsx - Improved layout and alignment
