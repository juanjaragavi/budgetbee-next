# BudgetBee Migration Progress Document

<Context>

A migration is underway from the original Astro.js Budgetbee website (`/Users/macbookpro/GitHub/budgetbee/`) to a new Budgetbee Next.js codebase (this codebase we are working in). The current objective is to migrate the top-level pages, including all associated content and referenced media assets (images and/or media files) from the source site to the new Next.js project.

<Task>

1. **Audit Source Media URLs**: Search the _original_ Budgetbee website's top-level pages. Identify and extract all URLs referencing images and other media files.
2. **Migrate Top-Level Pages**: Replicate the content and structure of the original site's top-level pages within the new Budgetbee Astro.js project.
3. **Update Asset References**: Ensure the media URLs identified in Step 1 are correctly referenced or re-pathed within the corresponding migrated pages in the Astro.js codebase.
